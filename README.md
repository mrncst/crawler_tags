# crawler_tags
Crawler to audit tags in websites. By default it is configured to look for GTM, but you can change this object to another tag inside the font code.
The ideia is to read a csv or xlsx with a list of web pages from an sitemap.xlm file. And then, the crawler will audit all pages and check if all of them have the tag you're looking for.
